				<h4>Why am I seeing a &quot;Not Found&quot; error for my post?</h4>

				<p>The following are several potential causes/fixes for this issue:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Make sure you have not mistyped your blog name or post ID, and that you are
						using a post ID from a post on the tracked blog.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have recently changed your blog URL on Tumblr, you will have to
						update it in the tracker as well, via the “Manage Blogs” screen, before the
						tracker can find your threads again.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you have made your blog private only to Tumblr users (i.e. the switch in
						your blog settings that says &quot;Allow logged-out users to see this
						blog&quot; is turned off), your blog will also be private to the API which
						the tracker uses, and thus your posts cannot be retrieved by the tracker
						unless you make your blog public again.
					</li>
					<li>
						If you see many/all threads displaying this issue at once, it’s likely a
						Tumblr bug and will pass shortly; feel free to let me know what’s happening
						by sending me an ask, so I can post an announcement if I haven’t already.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Why can&apos;t I track open starters on Tumblr?</h4>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, due to the way Tumblr structures its information, RPThreadTracker
					cannot distinguish between different &quot;branches&quot; from an original post;
					Tumblr considers them all part of the same thread of interaction so the tracker
					can&apos;t monitor them individually. In order to track separate threads from an
					open starter you will have to move each interaction to its own base post and
					then track that.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h4>
					Why doesn&apos;t the{' '}
					<Link href="/tools" to="/tools">
						Export Threads
					</Link>{' '}
					tool include post dates and whose turn it is?
				</h4>
				<p>
					The export tool is intended as a way to download a full list of your threads
					during a period when the Tracker isn&apos;t performing its usual function for
					some reason (i.e. during a Tumblr outage), so it&apos;s intended to be a pretty
					lightweight process. Adding calls to Tumblr would make export process more
					resource intensive and take a lot longer, and assuming the tracker&apos;s
					connection with Tumblr is stable, you can get the same information from the
					usual thread tables.
